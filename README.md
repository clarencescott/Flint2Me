# Flint2ME Project

## What is Flint2Me?
Flint2Me is a project I would like to begin, offering very cheap pricing to assist highschoolers looking to get into engineering careers, highschool graduates actively preparing for engineering studies in college OR college students with minimal coding abilities looking to start a portfolio for themselves.

This project will have all the details in this README.md document once I have ironed out all the specifics. Flint2Me will also be available to middle-schoolers who are in some form of STEAM/STEM/Robotics acitivities.
